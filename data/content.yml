  The Coffea liberica tree grows up to 20 metres in height, producing larger
  fruits than those found on Coffea arabica trees. This coffee was brought to
  Indonesia to replace the arabica trees [quote]killed by the coffee rust disease[/quote] at
  the end of the 19th century. It is still found in parts of Central and East
  Java today.
